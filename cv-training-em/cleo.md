About Cleo

At Cleo, we're not just building another fintech app. We're embarking on a mission to fundamentally change humanity's relationship with money. Imagine a world where everyone, regardless of background or income, has access to a hyper-intelligent financial advisor in their pocket. That's the future we're creating.

Cleo is a rare success story: a profitable, fast-growing unicorn with over $200 million in ARR and growing over 2x year-over-year. This isn't just a job; it's a chance to join a team of brilliant, driven individuals who are passionate about making a real difference. We have an exceptionally high bar for talent, seeking individuals who are not only at the top of their field but also embody our culture of collaboration and positive impact.

If you’re driven by complex challenges that push your expertise, the chance to shape something truly transformative, and the potential to share in Cleo’s success as we scale, while growing alongside a company that’s scaling fast, this might be your perfect fit.

The Role

Cleo is radically different from the norm and we’re looking for a senior engineering manager to guide and further develop our engineers across our cross functional product squads. You will be responsible for the teams and pillar technical delivery as they create exceptional products for our customers, as well as the wellbeing and development of your reports.

You’ll be responsible for all people management of multiple squads and engineers within a pillar. This means hiring the right spread of TL’s, engineers (juniors, seniors and leads), and then coaching and developing them to deliver on the roadmap. You’ll build out the headcount plan and will be responsible for all hiring and team development within your area to support our growth.

You’ll be accountable for all engineering needs for multiple squads working closely with your counterparts in product, data and experience to build high-performing cross-functional teams so that they deliver impact on our company mission in the most effective way possible. We’ll also be looking to you to develop some of our current squad-focused Leads into more senior positions to support you in the future.

You’ll be responsible for all technical leadership; this means actively seeking out opportunities to improve or optimise processes, participating in design sessions, reviewing technical proposals and developing the technical roadmap for your area.

About You

We’re looking for a Senior Engineering Manager that has exceptional people leadership skills, with an understanding of building a culture of technical excellence. On top of this:

You are the kind of manager who is people first, technology second. We build environments to support our engineers to be the most impactful engineers possible. We have to strike the right balance between short term gains and longer term sustainability, and our engineering principles reflect this.
You have previously been a hands-on software developer, but these days get your kicks from software architecture and organisation design, debugging people and processes, and delivering through others.
You are a great communicator. We are a tight-knit engineering management team, who support one another to be the best leaders possible. You need to be comfortable challenging and supporting us. 
You are comfortable with change and can adapt to constantly changing circumstances. We’re growing the team, and we want you to grow with us on that journey. 
You practise a learning and growth mindset. We move quickly and experiment lots and we need you to help people learn and grow from their experiences. 

Our Tech Stack

Cleo is built as a Ruby on Rails monolith with a single React Native app frontend, utilising TypeScript. We also leverage Python for machine learning services and PostgreSQL for our database, all hosted on AWS. Our CI/CD pipeline is fully automated, with production deployments happening on every merge via Heroku. Our backend engineers deploy multiple times a week, and we release our frontend app to Google and Apple for review at least once a week.

While we take a pragmatic approach, we place a strong emphasis on quality. Our code is peer-reviewed, and we maintain automated testing using Minitest and CircleCI. We're also actively working towards a more modular architecture, focusing on separating concerns to achieve all the benefits of microservices within a monolith, while progressively refactoring our code as we build new features. Everyone in the engineering team contributes to driving our technical strategy, voices & ideas from all levels are valued: we are all owners at Cleo.

UK App access: The Cleo app is no longer downloadable in the UK. If you’re an existing user, you’ll still have access to the app. But some features won’t be available. Why? 99% of our users are based in the US – where financial health is often overlooked. We’ve decided to shift our focus to where we can provide the most value and make the greatest impact for users who need it most. Then we’ll be able to apply what we learn to better support our UK users in the future.
