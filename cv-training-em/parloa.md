About Parloa
Parloa’s ambition is to become an iconic AI Platform company serving Fortune 2000 enterprises, a unique opportunity to shape the next era of enterprise AI. With global enterprise customers, we are already proving the impact of our Agent Management Platform (AMP), which - beyond the initial success - is evolving into the AI Agent Management layer for enterprise AI transformation. We are building Europe’s leading engineering organization to set the global benchmark for engineering excellence.
Our mission is clear: deliver robust, enterprise-grade, resilient, and reliable AI solutions at speed. In a fast-moving market where sales cycles for multimillion-dollar deals can be as short as 1–2 months, speed is our currency. We are competing head-to-head with the big-tech companies and fast-moving AI-native startups. This is our moment to establish Parloa as a global leader in Agentic AI Platforms.
Our engineering team is building a Composable Customer Experience Platform with Packaged Business Capabilities (PBCs), giving customers the power to choose between a turnkey solution or a composable toolkit integrated into their enterprise stack.
Our engineering organization (120+ people, scaling fast) is structured into Customer Experience Automation (CXA), Product Platform, and Technology Platform—together delivering a Composable Customer Experience Platform. Think AWS-like granularity, but built to empower enterprises with speed, flexibility, and resilience.
This is a once-in-a-decade opportunity to define how Agentic AI will transform the enterprise. To win, we need elite engineering leadership: fearless, pragmatic, and obsessed with building high-performing teams that deliver outcomes at speed and scale.The Role
