Job Title: Senior Cloud Architect – GCP
Location: London, UK (Hybrid/Remote options often available) Company: EPAM Systems

Role Overview
EPAM is looking for a talented Cloud Architect to join their dynamic global team and help shape the future of enterprise cloud architecture for key financial services clients. You will work closely with the Cloud Architecture Team to spearhead the adoption and refinement of Google Cloud capabilities and strategy.

You will create innovative, repeatable architecture solutions and frameworks that drive the ongoing transformation of enterprise workloads in a secure, scalable, and cost-effective environment.

Key Responsibilities
Strategic Leadership: Support the evolution of Google Cloud capabilities within the organisation. Advocate for cloud best practices, strategies, patterns, and innovative technologies.

Architecture & Design: Build repeatable architecture patterns, blueprints, and solutions to enable enterprise workloads across Google Cloud. Develop decision trees to simplify technology product selection.

Governance: Oversee architecture governance, application reviews, and compliance tollgates for Google Cloud deployments.

Documentation: Craft high-quality, concise documentation to support frameworks, strategies, and execution plans.

Mentorship: Provide thought leadership, mentorship, and guidance to stakeholders and delivery teams. Drive continuous improvements within the Cloud Architecture function.

Collaboration: Collaborate closely with senior decision-makers, strategists, product owners, and engineering teams to align goals and deliver value.

Requirements
Experience: 3–5+ years of proven experience as a Cloud Architect or in a related role, with a comprehensive understanding of Google Cloud Platform services and products.

Technical Expertise:

Advanced knowledge of resource management on Google Cloud and expertise in Identity and Access Management (IAM).

Proficiency in networking and security services within the Google Cloud environment.

Hands-on experience with compute services such as Google Compute Engine (GCE), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), and Cloud Run.

Strong understanding of database technologies (Cloud SQL, BigQuery) and data ingestion/transformation.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Deep proficiency with Terraform and automation tools (e.g., Ansible).

Soft Skills: Strong written and verbal communication skills; ability to influence senior management and guide technical teams.

Education: Bachelor’s/Master’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field.

Certifications: Google Professional Cloud Architect certification is highly desirable.

What We Offer
Career Growth: Opportunity to work on large-scale digital transformation programmes with global clients.

Learning: Access to award-winning L&D programmes, including sponsored professional certifications (GCP, Azure, AWS).

Benefits: Competitive salary, pension plan, private medical/dental/vision care, and the EPAM Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP).

Culture: A diverse, multi-cultural environment with flexible working options (on-site, hybrid, or remote depending on the project).

Analysis for Your Career Strategy
Alignment: This role leans heavily into technical leadership and strategy, which aligns with your goal of moving away from pure contracting into a permanent strategic role.

Gap: While it is a "Senior" role, it is likely an Individual Contributor (IC) track role rather than a direct "Engineering Manager" or "Head of" role. However, at EPAM, "Architect" roles often carry significant influence and can be a gateway to "Director of Architecture" or Practice Lead positions.
