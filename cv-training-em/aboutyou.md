About the job
We are looking for a Lead Platform Engineer who will join our Cloud Platform Unit at SCAYLE (onsite Hamburg/Berlin) and have a transformative influence on the way we build, operate and run our platform.

The Cloud Platform team is the strategic owner and custodian of our global, high-performance e-commerce platform (SaaS, headless, multi-tenant, multi-region). We provide the robust foundation that powers SCAYLE, managing the entire critical infrastructure stack—including Kubernetes, networking (VPC, ingress, etc.), GitLab, and the core deployment pipelines. You will also take full ownership of essential platform components running on Kubernetes, such as scaling strategies, secrets management, and comprehensive monitoring, alongside our logging infrastructure built around Opensearch and fluentd. The platform is engineered for scale, regularly seeing traffic peaks that demand an infrastructure of several hundred nodes. Your mission will be to ensure its flawless, uninterrupted 24/7 availability while proactively driving its evolution, pushing the boundaries of its capabilities and operational excellence.

This is a role of significant organizational impact. We treat our internal development teams as key customers, and your contributions will directly influence their velocity and success. By championing essential automation and continuous advancement of our platform, you will play a crucial part in ensuring SCAYLE operates at peak efficiency. We seek autonomous, motivated, and self-driven engineers who are ready to embrace this challenge, take full ownership, and have a transformative influence on our infrastructure.
