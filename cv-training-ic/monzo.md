About Platform Engineering At Monzo

The Platform Collective builds and maintains the infrastructure, tools and processes that sets the rest of Monzo technology teams up for success. We work on a wide range of shared infrastructure, services and engineer tooling.

The Infrastructure Platform team sit within the Platform Collective and are responsible for running the Kubernetes clusters, service mesh and networking that all of Monzo's microservices run on. Our team is made up of backend engineers and cloud infrastructure experts, using our experience and software engineering skills to solve problems and manage our cloud infrastructure.

Our Infrastructure Platform team Has Two Focus Areas

We build and centrally manage the cloud infrastructure that underpins technology at Monzo, running components like Kubernetes and Envoy across AWS and GCP.
We help other platform teams to succeed at using cloud infrastructure by abstracting away the complexity and enabling them to solve real customer problems

We’re investing heavily in this team to support Monzo’s ambitions to grow from 10 to 20 million customers, expand the range of products to improve our customers’ financial lives and set up the foundations for scaling Monzo across the globe.

How we work 💻

Locations & Flexible Working: 

Our main tech hub is in London, but our engineers live everywhere in the UK— from Brighton to the Western Isles. 

We value meeting in person but there’s no pressure to come into the office, even if you're nearby. We believe you'll do your best work if you are where you want to be. If you live outside of London and we ask you to come into the office, Monzo will support you with the costs. ✨

Our offices are naturally social, especially Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, which happen to line up with our twice-weekly Monzo lunches & treat Thursdays 🍽️. Teams also schedule time together often for work and play – in or around the office, or online.

What You’ll Be Working With

As a Platform Engineer at Monzo, you will work across the full breadth of our core infrastructure and application platform. This role involves a balanced split of responsibilities between two critical areas: 

Platform & Infrastructure Engineering: Enhancing and maintaining our foundational tools and systems.
Working hands-on with our Kubernetes clusters, AWS infrastructure, and configuration management using Terraform.
Integrating and managing various open-source components to provide robust, scalable primitives for our engineering teams.
Software & Backend Engineering: Building and maintaining the services that abstract and orchestrate our infrastructure.
Designing and implementing backend services (APIs, controllers, etc.) that provide a simplified, self-service experience for other engineers.
Developing software for complex projects like infrastructure migrations, high-scale traffic management, or security tooling.
Required

We rely heavily on the following tools and technologies, please note direct experience in these technologies is not required and our interview process can be completed in any language:

Go to write our application code (there’s an excellent interactive Go tutorial here), in platform we build services to manage parts of the platform
Kubernetes most workloads we run are on Kubernetes with this team being responsible for the underlying cluster's management
AWS and GCP whilst our primary platform is in AWS our footprint in GCP is continually growing and we are increasing our maturity across both of these platforms
Terraform is primarily how we manage any resources deployed into the cloud
Envoy Proxy for our RPC service mesh

🤩We’d love to hear from you if…

To succeed in this role, you will need a strong background in both modern platform tooling and practical software development.

Software Engineering Foundation: You have significant professional experience in software engineering, demonstrated by writing, testing, and deploying robust backend services using strongly typed languages.
Cloud & Container Experience: You have hands-on experience working with AWS and/or GCP, and you are proficient with Kubernetes.
Automation & Infrastructure as Code: You are naturally inclined to solve problems through automation and have experience with Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform).
System Curiosity: You are deeply curious about systems, enjoy diving deep to investigate complex issues, and understand how modern distributed applications fail and scale.
Platform Mindset: You'd be excited to build a platform that enables success for everyone at Monzo, focusing on reliability, performance, and developer experience.
Comfort with Ambiguity: You're comfortable working in a fast-paced team that deals with ambiguity and evolving requirements.
