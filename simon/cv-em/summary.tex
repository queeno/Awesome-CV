\begin{cvparagraph}
      Hands-on Engineering Leader with 15+ years of experience building and scaling high-performance teams in AI-driven and data-intensive environments.
      Combines deep architectural expertise in Cloud-Native systems (GCP/AWS, Kubernetes) and secure, event-driven architectures with a proven track record
      of growing engineering units from seed to enterprise scale. A "builder-leader" who thrives on solving complex
      technical challenges—from regulatory compliance to distributed orchestration—while fostering cultures of ownership and engineering excellence.

      \begin{itemize}[nosep]
            \item \textbf{Organisational Growth:} Extensive experience defining hiring strategies and scaling engineering organisations
                  (from 3 to 50+), managing the full employee lifecycle to build high-trust, autonomous teams.
            \item \textbf{Technical Strategy:} Expert in bridging the gap between business goals and technical execution, designing
                  scalable, event-driven architectures (Kubernetes, Go) and "Golden Path" platforms that transform Developer Experience (DevEx) and product velocity.
            \item \textbf{Operational Excellence:} Dedicated to raising the bar on engineering standards, embedding security/compliance
                  (GDPR, ISO, SOX, NIST), and driving continuous improvement in CI/CD, observability, and system resilience.
            \item \textbf{Stakeholder Management:} Skilled in navigating complex multi-stakeholder environments, translating architectural
                  needs into commercial value, and managing multi-million pound budgets to align technical roadmaps with company strategy.
      \end{itemize}
